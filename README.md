### INTRODUCTION
  A measure of energy obtained from the consumption of edibles and drinks, as well as the energy expended during physical activities, is known as a calorie. Food items vary in their caloric content, influencing the energy they provide. Therefore, managing calorie intake is crucial to mitigate health issues like obesity, diabetes, and related conditions.In contemporary living, maintaining regular physical activity is essential for achieving fitness goals, promoting overall health, and managing weight. Activities such as running, walking, cycling, swimming, exercising, and even routine tasks contribute to calorie expenditure. However, the actual number of calories expended relies on personal aspects like age, metabolic rate, gender, height and the level of exertion in the exercise. While accurately quantifying calorie burn can be challenging, various methods such as activity tracker apps and heart rate monitoring offer estimations, albeit with differing levels of accuracy. Additionally, the Metabolic Equivalent of Task (MET) system , developed by researchers and endorsed by the medical community, provides a standardized approach to estimating calorie expenditure based on activity intensity.
To address the challenge of predicting calorie burn, this study aims to utilize machine learning algorithms. Specifically, Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, XGBoost Regression, and Random Forest Regression will be considered. The objective is to determine which algorithm can provide the most precise expectations of calories burned relies on attributes such as heartrate, age, activity term, weight, height, and temperature.
